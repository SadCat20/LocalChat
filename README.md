# LocalChatProject

This project is designed to create a local message network; It can be used by companies for instant messaging.

For example, teachers in schools, when the computer breaks down, you need to print something, etc. they call each other or the school's system administrator, and are forced to spend money on calls or messages on the Internet. Using local chat, you can solve this problem of wasting money.

We used socket, threading, sys, time, msg, and PyQT5 modules for creation.
